The Digital Renaissance: NFT Landing Page
This project is a modern, responsive landing page for a fictional NFT marketplace called "The Digital Renaissance." The design is inspired by classical art and architecture, blending it with a clean, contemporary layout to create an elegant and engaging user experience.

The entire project is built using a single HTML file and a single CSS file to demonstrate a clean, modular approach to web development.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and adjusts gracefully from large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile devices.

CSS Grid-Powered Layout: The page uses CSS Grid to create a complex, two-column hero section with a simple, flexible grid for the header and footer.

Layered Visuals: The hero section features a unique layered design, with the stone and hand images stacked on top of a vertical barcode.

Modern Aesthetics: The color palette and typography are carefully chosen to create a sophisticated and artistic feel, combining a light background with dark text and muted accent colors.

Interactive Elements: The NFT cards include a subtle hover effect to draw user attention, and the "Start" button provides a clear call to action.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the page structure and content.

CSS: For all styling, including responsive layouts and visual effects.

File Structure
The project is organized into a simple and intuitive file structure.
